Repository for the parallelization of the Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method. 

Parallelization implemented in Python version 3.8 using the native multiprocessing library. 

Code then benchmarked and analyzed to compare results of multiproccessed implementations. 
Loglinear models created using R and Rstudio to further analyze code behavior, and to make predictions of possible timing outcomes.
